# Gemini Context for the HopinHome Project

This document provides context for the Gemini AI assistant to ensure it can effectively contribute to the HopinHome project, adhering to its conventions and structure.

## 1. Project Overview

-   **Project Name:** HopinHome
-   **Description:** A real estate rental web application.
-   **Current Stage:** Early development, focusing on the creation and display of property listings.

## 2. Technology Stack

-   **Backend Framework:** Laravel
-   **Language:** PHP
-   **Frontend Templating:** Blade
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **Frontend Build Tool:** Vite
-   **Database:** Configured in `config/database.php` (likely MySQL or PostgreSQL).
-   **Testing:** PHPUnit
-   **Containerization:** Docker is available (`compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile`).

## 3. Core Models & Concepts

The primary data models identified so far are:

-   **`User` (`app/Models/User.php`):** Manages user accounts and authentication. Laravel's default user model is in use.
-   **`Listing` (`app/Models/Listing.php`):** Represents a single rental property listing.
    -   **Relationship:** A `Listing` belongs to a `User`. A `User` can have many `Listings`. This is established in the `add_user_id_to_listings_table` migration.

## 4. Key Directory Structure

-   **Controllers:** `app/Http/Controllers/`
-   **Models:** `app/Models/`
-   **Database Migrations:** `database/migrations/`
-   **Database Factories:** `database/factories/`
-   **Web Routes:** `routes/web.php`
-   **Blade Views:** `resources/views/`
-   **Blade Components:** `resources/views/components/`
-   **Frontend Assets:** `resources/js/` and `resources/css/`
-   **Feature Tests:** `tests/Feature/`

## 5. Agent Directives & Conventions

When making changes or adding features, adhere to the following:

1.  **Follow Laravel Conventions:** Maintain the standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and other Laravel best practices.
2.  **RESTful Routes:** When adding new resource routes, define them in `routes/web.php` following RESTful principles.
3.  **Database Changes via Migrations:** All changes to the database schema MUST be done through new migration files generated by `php artisan make:migration`.
4.  **Use Blade Components:** For reusable UI elements, create and utilize Blade components in the `resources/views/components` directory.
5.  **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** All styling should be done using Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in the Blade templates. Avoid adding custom CSS to `resources/css/app.css` unless for a justified, complex component.
6.  **Create Feature Tests:** All new features or significant bug fixes must be accompanied by corresponding feature tests in the `tests/Feature` directory to ensure correctness and prevent regressions. Use factories for creating test data.
7.  **Environment Variables:** Do not hardcode credentials or environment-specific settings. Use the `.env` file and reference variables with `env('KEY_NAME', 'default_value')`.

## Gemini Session Notes

-   **Vite is Essential:** I must use the `@vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])` directive for CSS/JS and not CDN links.
-   **Component-First Approach:** I should continue building pages by breaking the Figma design into small, dedicated Blade components.
-   **Server-Side vs. Client-Side Classes:** I must use Blade's server-side logic (e.g., `class="{{ $condition ? 'class-a' : 'class-b' }}"`) for applying initial styles, not Alpine.js's `:class` with PHP variables.
-   **Multiple Headers:** The application has distinct headers for the landing page (`landing-header.blade.php`), internal pages (`header.blade.php`), and authenticated users (`navigation.blade.php`). I need to be mindful of which one I am editing.
-   **Asset Paths:** All images and SVGs should be placed in the `public/images` directory and referenced using the `asset()` helper in Blade files.
